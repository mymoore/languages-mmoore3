## Node app project
For node project I created a unscrambling word game. I used a database built from another class to add words that the app will choose from. Then based off of the hangman structure, I create a game where you guess the scrambled up word. 

The question I asked chat was about an error I was getting and it helped me solve the issue. 
Error: SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string
